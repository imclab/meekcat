MeekCat Core is a C# framework built on top of Unity3D engine to support proper messaging system and provide UI widgets in a OO fashion. It uses a bunch of design patterns like strategy to perform switching of behaviours when it comes to the various controllers that it provides. It also provides a proper data pipeline to stream data into your build as well. This framework is still a work in progress and there are still bugs in some of the UI widgets as well. Thought of uploading it to the Unify instead.
